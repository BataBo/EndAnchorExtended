# EndAnchor

This mod is an extension of https://github.com/KxmischesDomi/EndAnchor and was inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4

## Overview

This mod adds an aditional block to the game called End Anchor which has 3 functions in the game based on how you crafted it:

### End Anchor as Respawn Anchor

The most basic use of End Anchor is a Respawn Anchor, place it in the end dimension charge it up with ender perls, click on it to set it as your respawn point and the next time you die in the end you'll be respawned on top of the End Anchor.
If the anchor runs out of pearls you'll be respawned in the overworld.

### End Anchor as Teleportation Tool

Exploring the end can sure be tidious, not if you have an End Anchor though, if you craft End Anchor with a lodestone compass, you can teleport to the lodestone the compass is pointing to, of course for a price of an ender pearl.
The lodestone must be in the end for this to work, and if the lodestone to which the compass is pointing to is destroyed the End Anchor will explode.

### End Anchor as an Item Recovery Tool

If you craft the End Anchor with a Recovery Compass for a price of an Ender Pearl you can teleport to the location at which you've died, and retrieve all of your stuff, hope you didn't fall into the void, this only works in the End Dimension.

## Features

- If the end anchor is not placed in the end dimension any attempts to use it will cause it to explode and spawn endermites
- You must firstly charge the End Anchor with Ender Pearls to use it
- When End Anchor is mined or exploded it will drop the compass that was in the crafting recipe
